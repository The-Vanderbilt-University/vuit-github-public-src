# Accessing Vanderbilt's Github Organization
A Github account and VUNetID is necessary for accessing the Organization. Instructions for creating an account can be found below. If you already have a Github account, it can be invited to the Organization and [**Creating an Account**](#creating-an-account) can be skipped.

## Creating an Account
1. Navigate to [Github](https://github.com/signup?user_email=&source=form-home-signup).
2. Create a personal email account using the following information: 
	1. **Email**: Github recommends using a personal email that you will maintain access to. You are welcome to use your VU email address, however access to your Github account can be temporarily lost if VU email access is terminated for any reason.
	2. **Password:**: Create an appropriate password.
	3. **Username**: Create an appropriate username.

## Invitation to the Organization
1. Reach out to a member of the Github team for Organization access.
2. Invitations are received via email. You will be prompted to log into your Github account, then log into SSO with your VUNetID and password.
3. Once joined, accessing your organization can be found under [Your Organizations](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-your-membership-in-organizations/accessing-an-organization).
